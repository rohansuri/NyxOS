# NyxOS
NyxOS is a 16-bit minimalistic OS, working in real mode completely written in assembly!

It was made to understand certain operating system concepts:
<ul>
<li>Boot loaders
<li>Boot process
<li>Kernel
<li>File systems (FAT12)
<li>BIOS interrupts
</ul>
And a lot more! Trust me there is a lot to learn when you start OS development<br>
About segmentation,real mode/virtual mode, sectors clusters cylinders tracks!<br>
How a file is saved on a disk etc

The following tutorials/projects are very helpful for anyone to start off with operating system development!

1) http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/write-your-own-os.html <br>
2) http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html <br>


Requirements:
<ul>
<li>NASM
<li>Virtual Box for testing
</ul>

For any queries regarding the project or starting OS development, drop a mail :) <br>
